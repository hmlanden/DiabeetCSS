# DiabeetCSS
This project takes data on poverty and diabetes and uses it to create an interactive graph on a single-page website. Graph shows the relationship between the percentage of a state's population in poverty and the percentage of a state's population with diabetes. Size of bubbles indicates the size of the sample for the diabetes data, since the CDC data wasn't drawn from a census.

All data came from 2014 reports compiled by the US Census Bureau and CDC. Data was stored in a .CSV file.

Languages and/or libraries used include the following:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- D3.js
