                        <p class="mb-0">The story that has not been getting out is that there is a clear and extraordinary correlation between obesity and social inequality. Obesity is invariably presented as a diet issue for nutritionists, whereas social inequality is deemed the domain of sociologists and economists. Put another way, even as the inequality gap becomes more and more obvious there's been a medicalisation of a social problem. Yet obesity is not just a matter for nutritionists: rather, it is a product of social inequality and requires a collective social response.</p>

                    <p>In order to better understand the relationship between poverty and diabetes, we performed an analysis using data provided by the United States Census Bureau and the CDC.</p>

                    <p class="h4 text-dark">Results</p>
                    <p>The correlation coefficient between the percent of the population in poverty and the percent of the population with diabetes is <strong>0.7156</strong>, which represents a strong positive relationship. Thus, we can expect in the United States that as the percent of the population with a income below the poverty level increases, we will see the percent of the population with diabetes increase.</p>
                    <p class="h4 text-dark">Potential Problems</p>
                    <p>The data point for Puerto Rico could indicate that, rather than a linear relationship, the relationship between the variables may instead be logarithmic. R^2 for the calculated linear regression is <strong>0.51</strong>, but for a logarithmic regression line, R^2 is 0.56, indicating that the points fit the logarithmic line slightly better.</p>
                    <p>Another potential problem lies within the data itself. While the poverty data is sourced from the US Census, the diabetes data is described as "Crude Prevalance." Sample sizes vary a great deal from state to state. In order to help take this into account, the size of the bubbles in the chart below reflect the sample size for the data on diabetes prevalence.</p>

In Western economies, low-income populations have been found to be more likely to develop diabetes (1,2).

These folks scarcely eat whole, fresh foods at all, and for good reason: We have made calories cheap, but real food expensive."

                            The findings shed light on the “risk cocktail” linking the disease with city life. Factors ranged from increased junk food consumption and lack of safe spaces for exercise to social isolation and economic inequalities.[...] In terms of diabetes, Krug said poverty is also a factor, as people in poorer countries have a harder time accessing healthy foods. Healthcare systems in more affluent countries are also better positioned to intervene to prevent diabetes in adult populations at growing risk.
